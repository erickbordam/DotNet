Conclusion
----------

The KYC360 project is designed to provide robust KYC entity management with advanced features such as filtering, searching, pagination, and retry mechanisms. The solution follows a multi-layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability. The retry mechanism ensures robustness and resilience in the face of temporary failures.

By utilizing base classes like BaseService, the project ensures code reusability and consistency across different services. The multi-layer approach, along with the separation of models and DTOs, enhances the project's scalability and ease of maintenance.
